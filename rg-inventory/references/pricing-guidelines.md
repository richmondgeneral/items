## Pricing Psychology

### Price Points
- $X.99 for items under $20
- $X.95 or round numbers for $20+
- Avoid $.00 endings (looks lazy)

### Anchoring
- Group similar items at different price points
- Showcase premium items to make mid-range seem reasonable

## Research Sources

### Sold Listings (Most Reliable)
1. **eBay Sold** - Filter "Sold items" in search
2. **Worthpoint** - Historical auction data (subscription)
3. **LiveAuctioneers** - Auction house results

### Listed Prices (Less Reliable)
- eBay current listings (shows asking, not selling)
- Etsy (often inflated)
- Ruby Lane (high-end, inflated)

### Condition Adjustment
- Research prices for similar condition
- Adjust ±20-30% for condition differences
- Note if research is for better/worse condition

## Seasonal Considerations

| Season | Hot Categories |
|--------|----------------|
| Spring | Garden items, outdoor |
| Summer | Americana, patriotic |
| Fall | Halloween, harvest |
| Winter | Christmas, gifts |

## Time-Based Pricing

### New Listings
- Price at researched value
- Allow 30 days at full price

### 30-60 Days
- Consider 10-15% reduction
- Add to sale/clearance section

### 60+ Days
- Evaluate: reduce price or hold for right buyer
- Some items are worth waiting for

## Square-Specific

### Pricing Display
- Include full price in listing
- Use "Compare at" for perceived value
- Enable discounts for multi-buy

### Shipping Considerations
- Factor shipping into pricing strategy
- "Free shipping" built into price vs. separate
- Flat rate vs. calculated

## Don't Undersell

**Red flags you're priced too low:**
- Sells within hours of listing
- Multiple inquiries immediately
- Buyer seems too eager

**When in doubt:**
- Price higher, can always negotiate down
- Better to reduce later than leave money on table
- Rare items: research more before pricing
