# Skills Migration

Richmond General operational skills are maintained in:

- https://github.com/richmondgeneral/skills

## Scope split

- `richmondgeneral/items`: static site pages, item assets, inventory data files.
- `richmondgeneral/skills`: reusable skill definitions (`SKILL.md`, references, helper scripts).

## Local policy

- Do not add new skill definitions to this repository.
- If a workflow needs a skill update, make that change in `richmondgeneral/skills`.
- Keep this repository focused on deployable site content and item records.
