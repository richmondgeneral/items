### DESCRIPTION FOR SQUARE/ONLINE LISTING

**Vintage European Tourist Glass Decanter with Diamond Pattern**

A charming example of turn-of-the-century European tourist glassware, featuring an all-over diamond-cut pattern with a distinctive Swiss cross motif pressed into the design. This decanter was likely produced in Bohemian glass factories (modern Czech Republic) specifically for the Alpine tourist trade between 1880-1920.

**The Story Behind the Glass:**
During the late Victorian era, Bohemian glassmakers dominated the European market, producing decorative glass "in huge quantities" for export worldwide. They cleverly created region-specific designs for tourist destinations - this Swiss cross pattern was made to appeal to visitors seeking Alpine souvenirs. It's the vintage equivalent of today's "I ❤ NY" merchandise!

**What You're Getting:**
- Clear pressed glass with sharp diamond-cut pattern throughout
- Swiss cross motif integrated into the diamond design
- Original cork stopper (showing age but functional)
- Band of vertical cuts at the base for added detail
- Perfect size for display or light use

**Condition Notes:**
The glass is in good vintage condition with no visible chips or cracks. The cork stopper shows its age but is intact. Some very light surface wear consistent with 100+ years of age.

**Perfect For:**
- Adding authentic vintage character to a home bar
- European travel enthusiasts or Swiss heritage collectors  
- Props for period settings or photography
- Anyone who appreciates honest vintage pieces with history

*Note: This is a decorative tourist piece from the era, not fine crystal. Priced accordingly as vintage barware rather than as a collectible.*
